# Is it a Bird? Is it a Plane?
A classifier built with Google's low-code ML Platform, [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train)https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train)

## Let's Start With Why
Major League Hacking organised a Global Hack Week, and one of the challenges was to use a low-code/ no-code platform. I stumbled upon Google's Teachable Machine while going through a rabbit hole of low-code tools, and was amazed by the ease with which I was able to upload my data and build a model in seconds!

## What's Next?
I intend to build the code to a web-app. Excelsior!
